Description: A package for measuring change between different versions of text
    by automatically or semi-automatically aligning text lines and measuring
    the change. It works kind of like diff or version control systems but
    focuses on measuring the change in contrast to focusing on solid version
    control. Furthermore, the package allows for (possibly user made) text
    cleaning functions that are applied before comparison.
