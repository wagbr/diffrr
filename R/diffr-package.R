#' foo: A package for computating the notorious bar statistic
#'
#' A package for measuring change between different versions of text
#' by automatically or semi-automatically aligning text lines and measuring
#' the change. It works kind of like diff or version control systems but
#' focuses on measuring the change in contrast to focusing on solid version
#' control. Furthermore, the package allows for (possibly user made) text
#' cleaning functions that are applied before comparison. Another feature is
#' the semi-automatic alignment that allows for fast computer decissions on
#' clear alignments of 100% matches and 0% matches while asking for human
#' input on more complex decissions.
